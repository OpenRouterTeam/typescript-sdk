# DataCollection

- allow: (default) allow providers which store user data non-transiently and may train on it
- deny: use only providers which do not collect user data.


## Example Usage

import { DataCollection } from "@openrouter/sdk/models";

let value: DataCollection = "deny";
```

"deny" | "allow" | Unrecognized<string>
```
